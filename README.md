###Final assignment for Coursera course "Getting and cleaning data"

This repo contains the dataset produced as a .txt file, the R script I used to produce it, the code book (CodeBook.md), and of course, this readme file.

Thanks for reviewing!

**_Special notes:_**
The R script suppose you already downloaded the original data set in your working directory. It should be a subdirectory called 'UCI HAR Dataset'.
This R script uses the UNIX filepath system and will work on Mac and Linux systems.
